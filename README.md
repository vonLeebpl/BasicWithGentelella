Basic Symfony 3.0 project implementing Gentelella template
=========

Gentellela Admin is a free to use Bootstrap admin template. This template uses the default Bootstrap 3 styles along with a variety of powerful jQuery plugins and tools to create a powerful framework for creating admin panels or back-end dashboards.

**[Template Demo](https://colorlib.com/polygon/gentelella/index.html)**

**Installation**

1. Create your symfony project in /your_symf_project/dir using any method you may use.

2. Checkout this git repository to your temp_git/dir

3. cd temp_git/dir

4. run in cmd window or terminal: git checkout-index -f --prefix=/your_symf_project/dir/ -a

5. Delete temp_git/dir.


This will overwrite your initial files in your symfony project and your are ready to go.
You may also install full copy of Gentelella using Bower to your Symfony project.

**Remarks**

This Symfony project splits Gentelella template into series of Twig files that you can modify according to your specifing needs.
I have modified a bit css, images and font directory structure, to simplify it.
Please note, this example do not implements the whole Gentelella demo but just index page.
It's just a starting point of further development of your specific project.

Included are some Gulp tasks examples.
To install Gulp you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Hope it helps someone.
