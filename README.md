You may also install Gentelella using Bower to your Symfony project.

This Symfony project splits Gentelella template into series of Twig files that you can modify according to your specifing needs.
I have modified a bit css, images and font directory structure, to simplify it.
Please note, this example do not implements the whole Gentelella demo but just index page.
It's just a starting point of further development of your specific project.

Included are some Gulp tasks examples.
To install Gulp you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Hope it helps someone.
